	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my Aston Animal Sanctuary website. This website has been produced for my 'Web Applications and Techniques
	 coursework in my second year at Aston University. This website is completely fictitious and the animals presented
	 on it are entirely made up. No offense is meant by the content presented and the images used are not my own.
	 The images have been collected from a variety of sites, and where possible I have tried to credit their owners.</p>
